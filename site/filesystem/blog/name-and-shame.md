This is a list of emails I have recieved that were sent to the address I provided as the support email for an extension I published on the [https://addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).

This extension has a single user: Myself.

Anyone on this is has surely sent similar messages to literally every extension developer on the platform.

Subject: Earn Revenue with Bing/Yahoo Feeds  

<pre>
I found you on the Mozilla store and wanted to reach out to offer you Bing and Yahoo feeds for your addons or websites you may own.

Our Bing hosted lander which is your search can earn up to $50 per 1000 searches, and our feeds can earn you up to $0.40 a click.   It is a premium product by invitation only and can easily be added to your websites or addons.

If this is something you would be interested in, I would be glad to discuss this further with you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Kind Regards
