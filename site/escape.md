Yeah, the shell-as-a-blog thing is a bit much, I don't blame you for not wanting to bother with it.

You can find versions of all the "files" in the terminal here:

- [Stacksort](blog/stacksort.html)
- [Colour Sort](blog/colour-sort.html)
- [String Interpolation and SQL](blog/string-interpolation-and-sql.html)
- [Hello World](blog/hello-world.html)

Also I have an [about](/about.html) page, just like everyone else on the internet.
